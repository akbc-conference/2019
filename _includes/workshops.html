      <p>AKBC 2019 will feature a few thematic workshops where you can deep dive into a particular topic and connect with other researchers working in the same sub-area. However, rather than deciding on the topics ourseleves, we are planning to open up the topic selection process and let the community decide based on discussions and feedback. Please visit <a href="https://discuss.akbc.ws">discuss.akbc.ws</a> to join the discussion!</p>
      <p>Current topics include:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsrr-akbc19">Neural and Symbolic Representation and Reasoning</a></li>
          <li>Scientific Literature Knowledge Bases</li>
          <li>Knowledge Bases and Multiple Modalities</li>
          <li>More coming soon!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      until 19 April, so make sure to book yours as early as
      possible. The tentative registration timeline is: <p>

      <p><strong>Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)</strong></p>

Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance. Do not purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.</p>
